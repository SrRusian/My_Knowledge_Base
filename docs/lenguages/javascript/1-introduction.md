# 1. Introduction

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that enables interactive web pages and dynamic user interfaces. It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript can manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages in real time, making websites more engaging and functional.

## Brief History

- **1995:** JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape and was originally called Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.
- **1996:** Microsoft introduced JScript, a JavaScript-compatible language for Internet Explorer.
- **1997:** JavaScript was standardized as ECMAScript (ES1) by ECMA International.
- **2009:** ECMAScript 5 (ES5) introduced many improvements and became widely adopted.
- **2015:** ECMAScript 6 (ES6/ECMAScript 2015) brought major new features like classes, modules, arrow functions, and more.
- **Present:** JavaScript continues to evolve with yearly updates, supporting modern web, server-side (Node.js), mobile, and desktop applications.

## Where is it used?

- **Web browsers:** For client-side interactivity, DOM manipulation, animations, and form validation.
- **Server-side:** With Node.js, JavaScript can build scalable server applications and APIs.
- **Mobile apps:** Frameworks like React Native and Ionic allow building mobile apps with JavaScript.
- **Desktop apps:** Tools like Electron enable cross-platform desktop applications.
- **Game development:** JavaScript is used for browser-based games and game engines.
- **IoT and embedded systems:** JavaScript can run on microcontrollers and IoT devices.

## Basic Syntax Overview

JavaScript syntax is similar to other C-like languages. Here are some basic elements:

### Variables

```js
let name = "Alice";
const age = 25;
var isStudent = true;
```

### Functions

```js
function greet(user) {
  return "Hello, " + user + "!";
}

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### Conditionals

```js
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("Adult");
} else {
  console.log("Minor");
}
```

### Loops

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

### Objects and Arrays

```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### Console Output

```js
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
