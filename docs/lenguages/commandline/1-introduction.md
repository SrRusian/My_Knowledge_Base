# introduction

The command line interface (CLI) is a text-based way to interact with your computer by typing commands. It allows you to navigate, manage files, and automate tasks efficientlyâ€”often faster and more flexibly than using a graphical interface (GUI).

## A Brief History

The command line has been around since the 1970s, long before graphical desktops. Early computers relied entirely on typed commands. Even after GUIs became popular in the 80s and 90s, the CLI remained essential for developers, system administrators, and power users.

On Mac, the CLI is called the Terminal. On Windows, it's known as Command Prompt or PowerShell. On Linux, it's usually called the shell or terminal.

## Why Use the Command Line?

- **Speed:** Many tasks can be done with a single command.
- **Automation:** You can script and repeat complex workflows easily.
- **Resource efficiency:** Uses less memory and CPU than GUIs.
- **Precision:** Directly target files, folders, and processes.
- **Remote access:** Manage servers and computers over the network.
- **Power:** Some advanced features are only available via CLI.

## Key Concepts

- **Command:** A word you type to tell the computer what to do (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`).
- **Argument:** Extra information you give to a command (e.g., `cd Documents`).
- **Option/Flag:** Modifies how a command works (e.g., `ls -l`).
- **Prompt:** The line where you type commands, usually ending with `$` or `>`.
