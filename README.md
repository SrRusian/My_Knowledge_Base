## 🛡️ My Knowledge Base - Pentesting & Cybersecurity

Welcome to **My Personal Guide**, a repository created to document, structure, and share both foundational and advanced knowledge in **offensive cybersecurity**, penetration testing (pentesting), and the use of essential tools within Kali Linux environments.

This guide is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, providing professional, navigable, and web-accessible documentation.
